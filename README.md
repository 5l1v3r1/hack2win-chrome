### Building vulnerable Chrome & patching the renderer

It would be hard to reproduce the full-chain exploit because Chrome & Windows version have 
to match what we targetted back in September 2018. The files for the renderer patch
via DLL injection are just here for reference
(in `inject/`).

Instead you can build a vulnerable version of Chrome and apply custom renderer patches
to reproduce the sandbox escape as a standalone exploit:
In an existing Chromium source directory, do `git checkout 271eaf && gclient sync`, then rebuild.
To apply the renderer patches required for the standalone sandbox escape, do 
`patch -p1 < /path/to/renderer-271eaf.patch`.


### Running

`pwn.py` is the web server that serves the exploit. Run it on Linux (or WSL) and start
Chrome in guest mode, then browse to `http://localhost:8000/`
